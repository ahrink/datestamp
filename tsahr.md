Code Explanation: tsahr.c

- provided implementation of program named tsahr (timestamp with automatic recording) that calls a separate program, /home/<USER>/uCode/ahr (presumably responsible for generating timestamps), and keeps track of how many times it's called within a specified time limit.

Header Inclusions:

<stdio.h>: Provides standard input/output functions (e.g., printf).
<unistd.h>: Includes POSIX operating system functions (e.g., sleep).
<stdlib.h>: Offers general utility functions (e.g., atoi, exit).
<signal.h>: Provides signal handling mechanisms (used for timers).
<time.h>: Contains functions for time manipulation (e.g., time).
<string.h>: Offers string manipulation functions (e.g., strcmp).
timer_handler Function:

This function acts as the signal handler for the SIGALRM signal (timer expiration).
When the timer expires, it simply prints "Timer expired!" to indicate the elapsed time.

main Function:

Command-Line Arguments:
The program expects two arguments:
-s: Indicates specifying a timer duration.
<seconds>: The number of seconds for which the program should run.
If no arguments are provided or an invalid format is used, the program displays usage instructions and exits.

Signal Handling:
The code sets up a signal handler (timer_handler) for the SIGALRM signal, ensuring the handler is called when the timer expires.

Timing and Record Keeping:
start_time: Stores the starting time when the program begins.
record_count: Tracks the number of times the /home/<USER>/uCode/ahr program is called.
The program enters a loop that continues until the timer expires:

Calls the external program to generating a timestamp.
Increments the record_count.
Gets the current time (current_time).
Calculates the time difference using difftime.
If the difference exceeds the specified duration (timer_seconds), the loop exits.

Output:
The program prints the total number of records (timestamps) generated within the specified time.
If no timer duration is provided (timer_seconds == 0), it calls the external program once and displays a message suggesting how to use the timer option.

Compilation:

Filename: Change <USER> in the system call (system("/home/<USER>/uCode/ahr")) to your actual username. 

Compilation Command: Compile the code using:

Bash
gcc -o tsahr tsahr.c
- gcc: The C compiler.
-o tsahr: The output filename is set to tsahr (executable name).
- tsahr.c: The source code file to be compiled.
